üñêÔ∏è Hi! I'm Nay and I'm currently learning to code.



<h2>üöÄABOUT</h2> 

This is the the first basic project of the Fullstack Bootcamp at Pe√±ascalF5 with Html and Css.

First steps with "header body main and footer"

**Objective:**

The goal of this project is to take the first steps in learning HTML and CSS by following along with the instructor and replicating what they demonstrate.
This approach allows students to become familiar with basic HTML and CSS structures and build confidence as they create a simple webpage.

**Instructions:**

    Follow the Instructor‚Äôs Steps:
    Pay close attention as the instructor builds a webpage step-by-step. Each student will follow along, coding the same structure and styles as demonstrated.

    Practice HTML Elements:
    Start by using HTML elements for text, images, links, and lists, replicating the structure the instructor creates. This will help you understand the purpose and usage of each HTML tag.

    Apply Basic CSS Styling:
    Use CSS to add basic styling like colors, fonts, and spacing, exactly as shown by the instructor. This will allow you to see how CSS is used to visually enhance and organize HTML content.

    Ask Questions:
    This project is designed to be an introduction. The goal is to understand the basics and start feeling comfortable with HTML and CSS.

‚úàÔ∏è Welcome to my journey.
